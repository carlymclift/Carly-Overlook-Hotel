<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- This project is a website for booking hotel rooms at the Overlook hotel. A user is logs in with a username (either 'manager' or 'customer1' with the number being anywhere from 1-50) and a password ('overlook2020' for both guests and the manager). 
- As a guest you will be taken to your home page that displays your booking history, and the amount you've spent. You can make a new booking by selecting a date. You will then have the option to filter the available rooms by type. To book, simply press the book button on the room you want and you will be asked to confirm the booking. 
- As a manager, you will be taken to a home page with all guest information. You can search for guests by name, and see all of their booking history. You will also see the hotel's daily metrics (occupancy, revenue, and number of available rooms for the day). To book, you need to select date, input the user id and room number from the available rooms show and select book. A manager can also delete a booking by ID number.
